            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of
                the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

        <h2>What's Fun About this Game?</h2>
        <p>It is common for many players to think they know where pairs are and to turn over the one they are sure of first, then be stumped finding its mate. A better strategy is to turn over a less certain card first, so that if wrong, one knows not to
            bother turning a more certain card over.</p>
